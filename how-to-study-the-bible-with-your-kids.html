K</a></div></div></header></div><div class="wrapper post__entry"><p>Recently I was talking to a friend who asked what we do for family devotions or how we study the Bible with our boys.  I think she hoped for a long, detailed excellent plan with deep theology, but my answer was simple.  We read the Bible and pray for others.  We are so blessed to have a lot of great resources and solid teaching at our fingertips via books, podcasts, articles, and sermons online, in our bookstores and libraries.  But sometimes I think we complicate things. </p><p>I do have a deep desire and pray every day that my boys will grow to be men of God who LOVE God's Word as any true believing parent probably does.  So, if that's my desire, what am I do today to encourage them?</p><p>So, here's our deep secret of Bible study with our boys.  We read the Bible.  Somedays we read one or two verses either due to chaos ensuing with a tantrum or baby's poopy diaper or simply because the questions they had over 2 verses led into such great discussion that's all we chewed on for that day.  We don't have a "set" plan, I do NOT agree with making sure you get "this much" read every day.  Quality vs quantity.  We were in Nehemiah in late December and when the new year hit the boys asked if we could start at the beginning, so we are now in late March and we are about to Genesis 24.  My 5 year old asked if we would die before making it through the Bible, I laughed and said possibly.  The 7 year old asked when we would get through the Bible, I said at this rate, we should be done by the time you leave for college.  And I am okay with that.</p><p>We also focus on praying for others.  Each of us will choose a name out of a little box that has index cards with a family or individuals name on it.  We will each pray for that family and usually I am texting that person either a prayer, asking for prayer requests or just letting them know they were prayed for today.  It is fun, especially to share the younger boys prayers with friends/family.  The 5 year old prayed and thanked God for Mr. Gene and Mr. Gene's hot tub, because it is so fun.  Again, not deep theology here, but I hope and pray they are learning to focus first on Christ and then others.</p><p>There are some questions we ask each day after Bible reading that can help guide you:</p><ol><li>What does this text teach/reveal to us about God?  </li><li>What are the implications to obey?  I do not like the word application-how can I apply it?  Because in our self-centerdness we tend to apply it how we like it to fit, or how we think it should fit into our lives.  When I ask how am I to obey?  What is this text showing me about obedience in my own life, well then it's hard to combat.  It goes from application-self centered to obedience-self-sacrifice.  </li></ol><p>I was meeting with a mentor friend a few weeks ago I asked her now that she has grown kids what advice would she give me.  Her answer surprised me.  She said she never knew what deep impact her daily time in the Word had on her kids until recently (they're in college).  She said each of her kids has come to her individually and thanked her for her faithfulness and desire for the Word and how that has deeply impacted their walk and their lives.  Wow.  </p><p>I can't give my kids what I don't have.  I can't minister to them and teach them the Word if I don't know it and if I am not obeying it.  They're kids they know when you're faking it and they now hypocrisy from a very young age.  </p><p>Deuteronomy 6:4-9 says, "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.  You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.  And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart.  YOu shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise.  You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.  You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates."</p><p>I believe these verses call us as parents to a deeper faith for US first.  When I love the Lord with all my heart and my soul and my might then BY GOD'S GREAT GRACE I can teach them diligently to my children.  It becomes natural, not forced.  It is me beholding my great, great Savior and my children seeing and tasting that sweetness I am beholding.  </p><p>There are a few resources I have found to be helpful if you're new but have a desire to teach your children and discuss the Bible together.  </p><p>For prayer I have used a few things, but I think Leslie Nunnery at Teach Them Diligently has a fantastic Scripture based prayer guide for our kids.  You can find it <a href="https://teachthemdiligently.net/resources/prayers-for-my-children/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here at Teach Them Diligently's Website</a>.</p><p>Also, a book I would recommend to help get you started is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Neglected-Grace-Jason-Helopoulos-ebook/dp/B00DQBO290/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=a+Neglected+grace&amp;qid=1585260809&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Neglected Grace by Jason Helopoulos</a>.</p><p>In conclusion, don't stress.  Keep it simple.  Get in the Word daily yourself as much as possible, your walk with God will have a greater impact on your kids than you will ever know.  From that the conversations will naturally flow as your eyes begin to behold the majesty of God your kids will naturally be curious and discussion is sure to ensue.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on March 26, 2020</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a
