                <p>Dear first time mom,</p>
<p>I reached out to a few friends and have compiled some advice and encourage for you as you begin your new journey of motherhood. Maybe you can feel that little bundle swirling around inside you as you read this or maybe you’re up at midnight with pregnancy heartburn. Whatever your scenario is right now, the most important thing to know is, this baby is a gift from God. Psalm 127:3 says, “Children are a blessing, a gift from the Lord.” There is no planner way to say it, and I find it interesting and profound that God did not put stipulations on when a child is a blessing. For example, He did not say children are a blessing if their born in wedlock when you’re expecting him/her. Or to those who have enough money saved up to pay for everything the baby needs in the first year of life, He doesn’t even put the stipulation that the child must come from your womb to be a blessing and a gift. He simply says, “Children are a blessing, a gift from the Lord.” So, sweet momma who is tired already remember this child is a blessing and a gift from God Himself so be thankful for the gift.</p>
<p>Advice you have probably already received is to rest when your baby rests. There is a reason who have already received this advice, because it is true and you should do it. More than that you should not feel guilty about the dishes, laundry or mess in the living room you should just REST. Raising, training and healing are hard work. Also, even when the baby is awake take time to just enjoy the gift of this life. The laundry, dishes and dust will always be there, but these precious moments to watch your child grow and learn will fly by. Try to relish them before they’re gone.</p>
<p>Be gracious. You and your husband are new to this parenting thing, and the truth is it doesn’t matter if you have 1 or 10 kids we are all fully reliant on the grace of God every day in life and parenting. Take time AWAY from the baby even if it is just an hour to talk to your husband, be with him, ask him about his work, remember he was the one you fell in love with first and he will be the one holding your hand when you’re wrinkly and gray-haired. Nurture your relationship with your husband. Accept help offered by friends to babysit or bring a meal or hold the baby. All of these things are taking something off your plate and you will be a better woman for it. Be gracious with your husband as he learns you in the role of motherhood, it won’t come overnight to either of you but stick together, remember you’re on the same team and God has given you a great task TOGETHER to nurture and raise a child in the way they should go.</p>
<p>Now pray over that sweet baby and get some rest, sweet momma.</p>
<p>I’ll write more later, sincerely,</p>
<p>         Michelle K</p>

                <p><em>Here it is, easily the most requested recipe I have!! Everyone who eats these asks for the recipe and then I chuckle a little and say these are so easy you’ll think I’m lying. But alas, I am not. There are so many great things about this recipe I love. There are 3 ingredients! They are ooey and super gooey, quick, easy and delicious healthier option cookies. This recipe does not make a ton so I am not tempted to eat 2 dozen cookies, and they’re perfect for a little family surprise dessert. I think my absolute favorite thing about these is how easy it is for the kids to help without me stressing about a mess. </em></p>
<p><em>I confess, I get stressed when those big brown eyes come and ask me if their little hands can “help” me in the kitchen. Every mom everywhere knows that just means you have more to clean up, but with these cookies it is so doable and dare I say even enjoyable for all. They are still processed chocolate chips so I can’t call them healthy, but they are a healthy and certainly healthier option than most. So, here it is the long awaited healthy option cookie recipe.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Healthy Option Cookies</p>
<p>Makes about 8-10 cookies</p>
<p>2 bananas</p>
<p>1 cup oats (GF oats for Gluten allergy)</p>
<p>½ cup chocolate chips (Enjoy Life-allergy friendly or dark chocolate)</p>
<p>Directions</p>
<p>Mash bananas add oats and chocolate chips. Mix. Roll 1-2 inch ball size “dough” with hands and place on cookie sheet. Bake at 350° for 10-12 minutes. Let cool a little but don’t miss out on the warm gooey, delicious mess they are fresh from the oven!</p>

                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>1 can black beans</li>
<li>1 avocado</li>
<li>1/3 cup coconut oil (melted)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/3 cup raw cacao powder (cocoa powder)</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
<li>¼-½ cup raw honey (more if you desire more sweetness)</li>
<li>Optional: ¼ cup dark chocolate chips (Enjoy Life is allergy friendly)</li>
</ul>
<p>Directions</p>
<p>Drain beans and blend beans, avocado and coconut oil then pour ingredients into a medium bowl. Add all other ingredients and mix. Bake at 350⁰ for 35 minutes in a 9x13” pan or bake 40 minutes in a 9x9 for thicker brownies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>I know you may be hesitant to try the black beans and avocado in a brownie mix, right? I confess I was too, but these are a hit. This is my go to for an easy to make dessert so my allergy son can have a treat when we go to cookouts, birthday parties or the like. </em></p>
<p><em>They have a deeper taste than your run of the mill brownie mix or even gluten free brownie mix. I have had a lot of compliments from people that they are still sweet, but a very nice subtle sweetness. These are allergy friendly for no gluten or dairy and the big bonus is my kids are getting fiber (beans) and good fat (avocado and coconut oil) without even knowing it! Mom win!</em></p>
