                <p>During this time being home more often than usual I have been enjoying each night a different boy cooking by my side.  It's been a lot of fun and a great bonding time together.  I stumbled upon this website <a href="https://sl290.isrefer.com/go/kcrf/Indyboymom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kidscookrealfood.com</a> and I absolutely love her process!  She does a great job of meeting a child where they're at and helping teach the parents/guardians how to let the child help in the kitchen.  I wanted to highlight this because right now she is offering a <a href="https://sl290.isrefer.com/go/kcrf/Indyboymom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 week free trial</a> and after that for a limited time you can get a 2 month membership for just $19.  This is a great deal, and you don't have to decide until your two week free trial is up anyway.  </p>
<p>So, enjoy the time with your kids!  Bake and cook in the kitchen together.  Teach them skills (or maybe learn them yourself) that you normally wouldn't take the time to learn together.  Now is your chance and I highly recommend <a href="https://sl290.isrefer.com/go/kcrf/Indyboymom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this course</a> to help you!</p>

                <p>With all that is going on there are some amazing free trials and free subscriptions going on too!  Business are getting creative and also just wanting to meet a great need that is out there currently.  Here is a list of 4 education resources that I highly recommend!  Some of them are free for a limited time only.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://iahe.net/keep-calm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IAHE.net</a>
<ul>
<li>Indiana Homeschool Convention is online for free until April 10th.  After April 10th I believe there will be a small fee, but this is an amazing resource.  Not only are there solid teachings and workshops to equip and encourage home education there is also an online exhibit hall to check out curriculum, books, educational games and the list goes on!  I attend the Indiana Homeschool Convention each year and have never been disappointed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://teach-them-diligently-at-home.heysummit.com/?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Teach+Them+Diligently+AT+HOME+Is+Coming+Soon%21&amp;utm_campaign=TTDatHome+is+OPEN%21%21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Teach Them Diligently</a>
<ul>
<li>I have not been to a Teach Them Diligently conference yet, but I am extremely excited that they are offering so much of their conference online right now.  It is $20 (super cheap for so much GREAT info) or $60 which includes a membership (membership is normally $99, so another great deal).  I really respect the leadership at Teach Them Diligently and this is another great resource for looking into homeschooling or for veteran homeschoolers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://homeschoolsummits.com/parenting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parent Summit</a>
<ul>
<li>This is a parent summit, lot's of solid speakers encouraging parents.  We have attended their online homeschool summits before and enjoyed the Biblical teaching we received so I am sure this new parenting summit will be uplifting and Biblical also.  It is free.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="www.daveramsey.com/hope" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Financial Peace University</a>
<ul>
<li>We love Dave Ramsey and I respect that during this difficult time financially for so many people Ramsey Solutions is offering the Financial Peace University class absolutely free for 2 weeks.  You can totally binge watch it.  Even if you have already seen it, chances are it could be an older version you saw and you will learn something new or hear something afresh in it.  This is a GREAT tool to pass on to friends or family as we all know people drastically impacted financially through these recent times.</li>

                <p>Recently I was talking to a friend who asked what we do for family devotions or how we study the Bible with our boys.  I think she hoped for a long, detailed excellent plan with deep theology, but my answer was simple.  We read the Bible and pray for others.  We are so blessed to have a lot of great resources and solid teaching at our fingertips via books, podcasts, articles, and sermons online, in our bookstores and libraries.  But sometimes I think we complicate things. </p>
<p>I do have a deep desire and pray every day that my boys will grow to be men of God who LOVE God's Word as any true believing parent probably does.  So, if that's my desire, what am I do today to encourage them?</p>
<p>So, here's our deep secret of Bible study with our boys.  We read the Bible.  Somedays we read one or two verses either due to chaos ensuing with a tantrum or baby's poopy diaper or simply because the questions they had over 2 verses led into such great discussion that's all we chewed on for that day.  We don't have a "set" plan, I do NOT agree with making sure you get "this much" read every day.  Quality vs quantity.  We were in Nehemiah in late December and when the new year hit the boys asked if we could start at the beginning, so we are now in late March and we are about to Genesis 24.  My 5 year old asked if we would die before making it through the Bible, I laughed and said possibly.  The 7 year old asked when we would get through the Bible, I said at this rate, we should be done by the time you leave for college.  And I am okay with that.</p>
<p>We also focus on praying for others.  Each of us will choose a name out of a little box that has index cards with a family or individuals name on it.  We will each pray for that family and usually I am texting that person either a prayer, asking for prayer requests or just letting them know they were prayed for today.  It is fun, especially to share the younger boys prayers with friends/family.  The 5 year old prayed and thanked God for Mr. Gene and Mr. Gene's hot tub, because it is so fun.  Again, not deep theology here, but I hope and pray they are learning to focus first on Christ and then others.</p>
<p>There are some questions we ask each day after Bible reading that can help guide you:</p>
<ol>
<li>What does this text teach/reveal to us about God?  </li>
<li>What are the implications to obey?  I do not like the word application-how can I apply it?  Because in our self-centerdness we tend to apply it how we like it to fit, or how we think it should fit into our lives.  When I ask how am I to obey?  What is this text showing me about obedience in my own life, well then it's hard to combat.  It goes from application-self centered to obedience-self-sacrifice.  </li>
</ol>
<p>I was meeting with a mentor friend a few weeks ago I asked her now that she has grown kids what advice would she give me.  Her answer surprised me.  She said she never knew what deep impact her daily time in the Word had on her kids until recently (they're in college).  She said each of her kids has come to her individually and thanked her for her faithfulness and desire for the Word and how that has deeply impacted their walk and their lives.  Wow.  </p>
<p>I can't give my kids what I don't have.  I can't minister to them and teach them the Word if I don't know it and if I am not obeying it.  They're kids they know when you're faking it and they now hypocrisy from a very young age.  </p>
<p>Deuteronomy 6:4-9 says, "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.  You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.  And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart.  YOu shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise.  You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.  You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates."</p>
<p>I believe these verses call us as parents to a deeper faith for US first.  When I love the Lord with all my heart and my soul and my might then BY GOD'S GREAT GRACE I can teach them diligently to my children.  It becomes natural, not forced.  It is me beholding my great, great Savior and my children seeing and tasting that sweetness I am beholding.  </p>
<p>There are a few resources I have found to be helpful if you're new but have a desire to teach your children and discuss the Bible together.  </p>
<p>For prayer I have used a few things, but I think Leslie Nunnery at Teach Them Diligently has a fantastic Scripture based prayer guide for our kids.  You can find it <a href="https://teachthemdiligently.net/resources/prayers-for-my-children/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here at Teach Them Diligently's Website</a>.</p>
<p>Also, a book I would recommend to help get you started is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Neglected-Grace-Jason-Helopoulos-ebook/dp/B00DQBO290/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=a+Neglected+grace&amp;qid=1585260809&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Neglected Grace by Jason Helopoulos</a>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, don't stress.  Keep it simple.  Get in the Word daily yourself as much as possible, your walk with God will have a greater impact on your kids than you will ever know.  From that the conversations will naturally flow as your eyes begin to behold the majesty of God your kids will naturally be curious and discussion is sure to ensue.</p>

                <p>Fear, worry, stress, anxiety, job loss, financial strain and unparalleled health concerns.  Where are we going to turn when the stress comes?  I think this is a time for believers to rise up, this can be a time of revival.  A time that we lean into the Lord like never before and trust Him more deeply, because He is always trustworthy.</p>
<p>I am a certified Biblical counselor through <a href="https://biblicalcounseling.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACBC</a> and here are some practical tips for combatting fear and anxiety I would offer during these uncertain times.</p>
<ol>
<li>Think, Act, Feel.  We innately feel, act and then think, but if we are constantly acting off of our feelings-fear, worry, stress then we are not acting in a way that is honoring to God.  First we need to think rightly-ask God to renew our minds-help us to put off the wrong thoughts and sinful desires and put on what honors Him.  Ephesians 4:22-24</li>
<li>Memorize scripture: proclaiming the truth even to yourself is powerful.  If we are going to fill our minds with the latest on the coronavirus we will be consumed with thoughts about the coronavirus.  If we choose to fill our minds with the truth of God's Word we can be consumed with thoughts of truth and peace no matter what the circumstances.  Here is a short list of some Scriptures to memorize regarding fear/worry:  
<ul>
<li>Romans 8:15</li>
<li>2 Timothy 1:7</li>
<li>Hebrews 13:5-6</li>
<li>Psalm 27:1</li>
<li>Psalm 56:3-4, 10-11 </li>
<li>1 John 4:18</li>
<li>Philippians 4:4-8</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read the Bible and pray.  Turn off the tv/internet/phone and read your Bible and pray.  2 great books for prayer is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0758640331/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0758640331&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=indyboymom-20&amp;linkId=b2bcfc40581e508acdd43316815c4f0b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Simply Way to Pray by Martin Luther</a>, it's a small book that teaches you how to pray.  Also, a great book of Puritan prayers called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0851518214/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0851518214&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=indyboymom-20&amp;linkId=0bd72b81cca22b24e7b7fe9a34f2bc16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Valley of Vision</a></li>
<li>Read this book I recommend to almost every single counselee and I have read more times that I can count is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HTKF0FO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00HTKF0FO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=indyboymom-20&amp;linkId=82786a6cecbe53d3b7b41d9a18c325b5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trusting God by Jerry Bridges</a>.  The root of our worry and fear and anxiety is that we are not at rest and trusting in God, which we all struggle with at times.</li>
<li>Lastly, here is a link to an incredibly <a href="https://www.challies.com/articles/how-the-world-worshipped-on-one-of-the-most-unusual-sundays-in-church-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">encouraging post</a> by Tim Challis about worship taking place around the globe.  It may look different everywhere, but God is being worshiped and that is encouraging!!</li>

                <p>We are definitely living in a different world than we were just a few weeks ago.  There is not a person unaffected, so during these challenging times we can get bitter or better and I choose better.  I exhort you to set an example to your kids in these times, not an example of perfection but an example of choosing to be a blessing where you can, being patient and enduring with grace and love.    </p>
<p>I know a lot of moms or dads or grandparents are home with kids right now unexpectedly and for God only knows how long, so I wanted to offer some great tips of things to do during this time.</p>
<p>It's our nature to be focused on ourselves and a time like this is no exception and is a time where you see that selfishness even more.  So, here are 6 things to do with your kids to focus on others!</p>
<p><strong>6 ideas to focus on others while quarantining!</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Write a letter or draw a picture for:
<ul>
<li>first responders</li>
<li>local firehouse</li>
<li>local police station</li>
<li>local courthouse/government</li>
<li>military/service men and women either those you personally know or go <a href="https://www.operationgratitude.com/express-your-thanks/write-letters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li>
<li>family/friends you currently cannot visit</li>
<li>pediatrician/family doctor and nurses</li>
<li>local hospital or nursing home staff</li>
<li>pastors/pastoral staff</li>
<li>teachers/school staff</li>
<li>someone you know who is in the hospital or nursing home or go <a href="http://www.cardsforhospitalizedkids.com/make-cards.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li>
<li>local grocery store-have you seen these peoples faces recently?  I am pretty sure a simple thank you and a card from a child thanking them would make their day pretty easily!</li>
<li>think of people in your area that may be feeling the impact in a different and possibly more difficult way than you and your family and encourage them with a letter of thanks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pray for:
<ul>
<li>our government</li>
<li>those who have lost someone to this virus</li>
<li>doctors and nurses</li>
<li>those working to develop and find a cure or vaccine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anonymously bless a neighbor with something they may need: some money in an envelope, some diapers left on their porch, some toilet paper for goodness sakes!  Make it a little care package-put some kleenex, hand sanitizer, a nice note in it.</li>
<li>Do chores for each other-each person come up with something (within reason) that would be helpful to another family member and do it.</li>
<li>Make a craft for someone your child loves: neighbors, grandparents, parents, etc.  </li>
<li>CALL a friend.  Calling someone is when your cell phone actually goes up to your ear and you talk to the person, you can even hear their voice.  It's a completely lost art nowadays, we don't know our phones can be used for talking besides talk text.  Call a different friend each day to see how they are doing.  Try it, I think you'll like it!</li>

                <p>Being gluten or wheat free is difficult, one of the main food items my son misses is bread.  Our bread today is just not at all what it used to be and it is lacking nutrients and enzymes that once were there prior to so much processing.  This recipe is a very easy go to for me and I make it almost every day.  My son cannot have wheat or his tummy will hate him for it, so we have found spelt or barley flour to be preferrable for him.  I have tried this recipe with my King Arthur's Gluten Free flour and it did not work for me, but if you're brave go for a gluten free try!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ingredients</span></p>
<p>2 cups spelt flour</p>
<p>3 teaspoons baking powder</p>
<p>1/2 teaspon salt </p>
<p>3/4 cup water</p>
<p>1/4 cup oil (we use olive oil)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Directions</span></p>
<p>Pour all dry ingedients into a bowl and mix.  Then add wet ingredients and stir until dough is formed.  Spoon 2 tablespoons of dough for each biscuit on a cookie sheet.  Makes 6-9 biscuits.  Bake at 400° for 10-12 minutes. I like to take the measuring cup I had the oil in and mix about 2 teaspoons of honey in it and brush that on top of the biscuits once they come out of the oven.  </p>

                <p>If you live in Indiana you know the drill, wait 10 minutes and the weather will be different.  So, Spring is sometimes in the air currently in Indy!  At least spring break is right around the corner for most Indianpolis area schools, so I thought I would compile a short list of some fun places to visit in Indy on a tight budget.  We try to include as much education as possible so tagging on science and history to a family outing is easy and fun, even if you are on spring break!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Indiana War Memorial</span>-This is a beautiful building and admission is FREE.  It is a great museum, enjoyed by even the younger kids.  The helicopter is always the highlight for my boys.  There is easy street parking available at a minimal cost and with the museum being free it is worth the price.  There is a nice park in front of the memorial also and the Central Library is walking distance too.  </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Canal walk</span>-The canal is always a beautiful place to walk around, there are a few memorials you can check out on or right by the canal.  The 9/11 Memorial, Medal of Honor Memorial (beautiful at night), and the USS Indianapolis Memorial.  There is also a newer playground called the Colts Canal Playscape that is a great place for the kids to burn some energy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Newfields</span>-the art museum itself does cost, but if it is a nice day take full advantage of the beautiful outdoor acres.  There is a garden and 100 acres of nature with artwork throughout.  Areas to play, picnic and a pretty lake to enjoy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Garfield Park Conservatory</span>-this is a favorite for us around Christmas because they have trains and beautiful lights throughout the greenhouse area.  There is no charge, but they do ask for donation.  This is a nice getaway to be in nature in Indy when it is 15° outside in winter or enjoy the outdoor area also on warmer days.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eagle Creek Park</span>-Admission is $5 per vehicle for in county and $6 for out of county residents.  This park is beautiful and is one of the top 10 largest municipal parks in the country. They have hiking, boating, fishing and playgrounds just to name a few activites.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fort Harrison State Park</span>-This is our go to park on those beautiful, sunny Indiana days!  We love the creeks, hiking trails and the big slide is a favorite for our boys.  Fort Harrison also has horse rides available.  Admission is $7 for in state residents and $9 for out of state.</p>

                <p>"One person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike.  Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind."  Romans 14:5  </p>
<p>I believe this chapter of Romans is a great dose of what we need regarding school choices.  Paul is saying not to pass judgement on another believer because of their decisions, one can honor the Lord by eating and celebrating a holiday just as much as another can not eat and not celebrate a holiday and honor the Lord.  The point is that the Lord is honored.</p>
<p>So, I believe each parent should be fully convinced in their own mind that they are honoring God by their school choice for their child-public, private or homeschool.  I wanted to give that belief before diving into the topic of why we homeschool.</p>
<p>When my husband and I made the decision that we would homeschool our children I was fully prepared to hear the question regarding how our kids would ever be socialized.  Perhaps I haven't heard that because our boys have all 3 found a way to make friends with everyone from neighbors to grocery store employees and bank tellers.  The comments and questions I did not anticipate sort of strike a nerve for me. </p>
<p>Easily the number 1 comment is, "oh wow!  I don't know how you do it!  I could never homeschool my kids."  It doesn't strike a nerve because I get mad by any means, it strikes a chord of sadness.  Whatever the reasons are another mom may have for thinking she cannot homeschool is probably a complete lie.  Yes, you can homeschool.    </p>
<p>This idea that you have to be a saint to homeschool your children is rubbish.  No homeschool mom is a saint.  We may be brave or out of our minds, but a saint, no.  Homeschooling is a continuation of parenting.  For me personally, I cannot reconcile the scripture from Proverbs 22:6 "Train up a child in the way they should go..."</p>
<p>Those 10 words are why we homeschool.  I figured it this way.  There are 168 hours in a week.  We sleep roughly 56-70 hours of that week and if I sent my kids to school they would be gone 35-40 hours depending on travel time/bus, etc.  So, I would not be with my kids at least 91 hours of the 168 I have been given by God to train them up every week.  And of course, we live in a culture where we must keep busy, so add in the time for extra curricular activities or even minstry or volunteer involvement and that 91 hours dwindles even quicker.  We would be left with roughly 80 hours a week to train up our child in the way they should go.  Again, refer to paragraph 2 and 3 and remember I am not saying this is for every parent, I am saying this was our journey and our personal conviction.  </p>
<p>I cannot reconcile my God given role to train up my kids Biblically with spending 80 hours a week with them and having to be louder so to speak than any other training up in the way they should not go.  I am not homeschooling to protect my kids from the world, I am homeschooling to prepare my kids to be in the world and a culture I pray every single day they will impact for the kingdom of God.  I am also not homeschooling my children so they will be Christians, because my best efforts will never save my kids. </p>
<p>So, I am not a saint.  Nor will I ever be even if we successfully graduate 3 handsome young men from our home school.  Parenting is a task beyond our human ability to succeed.  Parenting is hard.  Homeschooling is hard.  As a believer it is the most sanctifying undertaking, but it is also an incredible opportunity to daily see grace upon grace and the hand of God, because there is no way I could do it in my own strength.   </p>

                <p>"So, how did you two meet?"  </p>
<p>The question comes and I gulp hard, immediately the only question that comes through my mind is, how much can this person handle of "our story"?  Right, well, as you can guess it wasn't a conventional way my husband, Josh and I met.  In fact, in the 9 years I have been sharing our story no one has said, "oh yea, my friends met that way too!"  Most people are surprised, possibly a little confused, but I always hope everyone walks away seeing the magnificent, gracious God my husband and I serve.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful fall day in Indiana, the kind where the leaves haven't truly begun to fall, but they are vibrant with orange, red and yellow hues of Autumn.  I was asked to help a friend take photos at an event for a local rescue mission.  It was a homecoming event, interesting thing for a rescue mission, right?  Well, this was a homecoming event for all the men who had graduated the missions men's addiction recovery program and their families. </p>
<p>It was quite a peculiar event to me.  I had been a Christian quite some time, I had known grace and I had known the Gospel, but to be honest I believed certain people would never change.  The list was small, but there was still a list and at the top of the list I was convinced alcoholics do not change.  Of course, what a small view of God that was, but it was my belief at the time.     </p>
<p>So, here I am just doing my job of taking photos of families and people enjoying the games, food and fellowship, yet in my heart I was just baffled.  There were men with their wives and children laughing together and then I would hear testimony after testimony how that man and woman were reconciled after 3 years of separation due to his drug addiction.  Testimony of that dad who had burned every single bridge so badly his son wouldn't respond to phone calls, texts, letters, nothing, so in desperation he wrote his son a letter on a $5 bill because he knew he wouldn't throw it away.  Testimony after testimony of completey broken, unreconcilable circumstances being miraculously healed, mended and stronger than ever because of Christ.  </p>
<p>Apparently as I was just doing my job and my heart was being stirred to understand what I truly know of grace and mercy there was a man in the program.  A fresh recruit, nonetheless.  I think we both still blush when he utters the words, "I saw her from afar."  Josh had entered the program just a few short months before the homecoming event, he was in the first phase of the addiction recovery program and I caught his eye that fall day.  I had no idea he existed and that day began a 2 year crush he had on me.</p>
<p>I began working for an organization that worked in Burundi, Africa so I spent the next 2 years traveling back and forth to Africa minstering to orphans and widows and accepting my calling to be a single missionary woman for life.  The camp where the homecoming event took place is a beautiful, large property in the middle of nowehere.  My friend and I would visit and I loved to go down to their church services at the camp, but most of all I enjoyed getting away from the noise of the city right before I would leave for Africa.  I also frequently served at the rescue mission serving dinner to the homeless in downtown Indy.  It was January 2011, a bitter cold night and I went to the serve dinner at the rescue mission.  I rang the door bell and a handsome young man opened the door for me with excitement and a huge smile he said, "Hi, Michelle!" I smiled and said hello as I signed in and thought, how the heck does this dude know my name?  </p>
<p>We talked as we rolled silverware and we found out we were reading the same book.  First guy I ever met who read Tozer for fun in his free time.  I told him I was off to Africa for about 2 months and he asked if I would be at the camp church service that Sunday and I said I would.  After the church service that Sunday he came up to me and walked next to me to the car, he handed me a little booklet and told me he would be praying for me during my trip.  I thanked him and that was it.  All I knew about the guy was he was 2 weeks from finishing the internship part of the program, he was pretty cute, he read Tozer and his name was Josh.  I had no idea he had a crush on me for 2 years.  </p>
<p>I remember sitting in the backseat of my friends car on the way home that day as her and another woman chatted away and I cracked open the little booklet.  My heart may have skipped a beat as I saw he had written me a note and the booklet was a devotional book.  When I got home that day I went straight to my room and cried and prayed.  Who is this guy?  I don't know this guy!  I can't have "feelings" for some dude in a flippin' addiction recovery program!!!!  But that booklet.  He wrote a note about how he would pray for me and hoped this devotional book would help give me hope and strength as I was away from my family, friends and familiar life for 2 months, that I would lean into the Lord.  He could have just given me a note.  He could have given me any book.  But he gave me a devotional with the hope that I would lean into the Lord.</p>
<p>Well, my time in Africa was incredible.  I had sent Josh a short email simply saying thank you for the booklet.  He wasn't supposed to communicate until he graduated so I did not anticipate a return e-mail, if anything.  But every single day I was in Burundi God brought Josh to my mind and I prayed for him.  The one day I did not pray for him in the morning a fellow missionary was telling a Bible story to a group and talked about Sarai and Abram going to Hebron, which was the name of the camp Josh was located.  So, I prayed for him.  He graduated from the program in February and had permission to write me back, which he promptly did the very night he graduated.  We began communicating through e-mail during my time in Burundi and the e-mails were short at first and after 2 months they were basically novels back and forth.  3 times I remember freaking out and thinking, no way, this is insane.  I cannot develop feelings for a guy who JUST graduated an addiction recovery program!!!  And 3 times I knew the Lord was reminding me of what grace I have been given and that God is always trustworthy no matter what were to happen with this guy.  </p>
<p>Well, I returned home, he asked my dad for permission to date me and 4 months later asked my parents if he could propose to me, they said yes, he proposed and I said yes!  I used to think certain people could not or maybe just would not change.  There are numerous stories of heartache and relapse and we have walked beside many friends through those difficulties.  But there is this God and He does do miracles.  He takes what once was broken and somehow He makes it whole.  He takes a heart of stone and turns it into a heart of flesh.  He takes a thief and turns him into a generous man.  He alone can take a prideful, stubborn heart and soften it more and more each day.  So, as I share this story I hope and pray the same thing I do when I answer for someone in person.  My prayer is that this magnificent God we serve would be so evident in our story that others would know Him.  "We met at a men's addiction recovery program."</p>

                <p>I had one of those moments recently.  You know the kind, baby is on the tabletop like a ninja eating the markers as the noodles boil over and the 5 year old was throwing a fit because he suddenly hates the noddles he loved yesterday and asked for 30 minutes ago, while the 6 year old gives me a complete blank stare as I give a seemingly pointless lecture for the umpteenth time about putting his markers away and away does not mean the center of the kitchen table.  I glance at the clock and see the numbers laughing at me saying you still have 2 hours until your husband is home! </p>
<p>Yep, it was one of those moments.  The kind you just want to curl up in a ball and pull your covers over your head and hope everything is in order and your children are miraculously thankful, obedient humans when you come back out.  But alas, you're a mom and that is not an option.  These humans depend on you, not to mention you cannot leave the boiling over noodles=fire hazard.  </p>
<p>In these moments, I struggle.  I am pretty sure I am going to lose my sanity every time these moments come, but so far everything seems fairly in tact.  The greatest thing about these moments in the grand scheme of motherhood is they are just moments.  They do not last.  Some may be longer than others and yes, we have had hard seasons of parenting, but again we have come through it in the end.  I hope my boys will know in the struggle and chaotic moments of life there is deep grace.  These times are no different than any other at the heart of it; we seek the Lord, we pray a lot, we lean hard into the truths of God's Word and at least I can know my boys will know what a true apology is, because most of the time I am having to apologize for poorly handling the chaotic moments. </p>
<p>I would be sorely remissed to sit there though, to stay in the struggle.  Once it is done, it is done.  Calm comes again or some simulance of it anyway.  There are moments of struggle and chaos every day it seems in motherhood, but when we lay our head on the pillow at night I hope much more often than not we are filled with memories of the moments of laughter, snuggling reading a book, those sleepy brown eyes that gave me one more glance as he says I love you, Mommy. </p>
<p>So, sweet mommas, we all have those moments.  Moments of insanity it feels like, utter chaos abounding, but lets remember they are just moments, they will pass one way or another.  Even the long seasons will eventually pass and one day when I am older and gray I hope the moments me and my boys have stored away the most are moments of great grace and joy.         </p>
