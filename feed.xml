                <p>Most of us are stuck at home and some people are going crazy!  It is a tough transition for a lot of people and I can't imagine having a work from home job and having younger elementary kids you're trying to help with this e-learning.  It is difficult and it is a great time for us as Christians to show love to our neighbors even if we can't be closer than 6 feet away.  </p>
<p>Here is an idea of what we did!  The options are limitless I am sure, so be creative in your own way and bless your neighbors!  We did a movie night quarantine care package!  You can go to <a href="https://premium.vcdelivery.com/redbox/?cid=lp:link:gifts:8:15:2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redbox.com</a> and get a promo code gift card.  It may seem confusing, but I purchased the 5 promos gift card and had it sent to my own e-mail.  Then once it came to my e-mail I wrote the promo codes on the print outs to hand out to each neighboy.</p>
<p>Once you get the promo codes I printed the <a href="http://www.acupfullofsass.com/teacherappreciationgift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redbox move night printable from here</a>.  I liked these because a lot of them were teacher specific ones, but these were more generic so I could use them for neighbors.  We got .50 gift bags, gave them a few hundred grand (the candy bar) for hard times, microwave popcorn and wrote a note of encouragement.  Normally we would do this anonymously but this time we wanted to put our names and phone numbers if our neighbors needed anything to let us know.  We delivered them to neighbors by placing them, oh so stealthily on their front porch.  Great way for kids to serve!  This is the time for the church to rise up, to serve, to love others and to be the hands and feet of Christ even if we can't do that face to face.  I hope this inspires you to serve your neighbors, unebelievers or friends and family in some way during this time also!</p>

                <p>There are so many amazing resources being offered during these tough times for free or great deals.  I know how tempting it is to just turn the screen on for them, but here are some neat alternatives to screen time!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.whitsend.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adventures in Odyssey</a>-we LOVE Adventures in Odyssey.  We have a lot of the CD's and as soon as we get in the car the boys ask, "May we listen to Odyssey?"  even when we pull in the garage they ask, "May we keep listening to Odyssey?".  It is a favorite for the whole family.  Right now they have a 4 week free trial for their Kids Club.  My favorites are the episodes that are from historical time periods, like the recent Titanic episodes.  Some you may want to listen with your kids (especially to explain to a more sensitive child) but overall we have listened from about 4 years old up.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.educationalinsights.com/at-home-activities-for-kids" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Educational Insights</a>-this site is full of ideas!  Craft ideas, game ideas, even schedule ideas by age.  It is a great resource for ages 1-8 years old.  They even have videos, which I always find helpful for the crafts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.learningresources.com/free-at-home-learning-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learning Resources</a>-this site has free printables, coloring pages and learning tips by subject or grade Preschool-5th. A lot of their workbooks are free and able to be printed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hand2mindathome.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hand2mind</a>-this is a great resource for Spanish speakers, as they have their conent in Spanish and English.  There are daily schedules, activities by grade (K-5), and printable manipulatives even.</p>

                <p>During this time being home more often than usual I have been enjoying each night a different boy cooking by my side.  It's been a lot of fun and a great bonding time together.  I stumbled upon this website <a href="https://sl290.isrefer.com/go/kcrf/Indyboymom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kidscookrealfood.com</a> and I absolutely love her process!  She does a great job of meeting a child where they're at and helping teach the parents/guardians how to let the child help in the kitchen.  I wanted to highlight this because right now she is offering a <a href="https://sl290.isrefer.com/go/kcrf/Indyboymom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 week free trial</a> and after that for a limited time you can get a 2 month membership for just $19.  This is a great deal, and you don't have to decide until your two week free trial is up anyway.  </p>
<p>So, enjoy the time with your kids!  Bake and cook in the kitchen together.  Teach them skills (or maybe learn them yourself) that you normally wouldn't take the time to learn together.  Now is your chance and I highly recommend <a href="https://sl290.isrefer.com/go/kcrf/Indyboymom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this course</a> to help you!</p>

                <p>With all that is going on there are some amazing free trials and free subscriptions going on too!  Business are getting creative and also just wanting to meet a great need that is out there currently.  Here is a list of 4 education resources that I highly recommend!  Some of them are free for a limited time only.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://iahe.net/keep-calm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IAHE.net</a>
<ul>
<li>Indiana Homeschool Convention is online for free until April 10th.  After April 10th I believe there will be a small fee, but this is an amazing resource.  Not only are there solid teachings and workshops to equip and encourage home education there is also an online exhibit hall to check out curriculum, books, educational games and the list goes on!  I attend the Indiana Homeschool Convention each year and have never been disappointed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://teach-them-diligently-at-home.heysummit.com/?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Teach+Them+Diligently+AT+HOME+Is+Coming+Soon%21&amp;utm_campaign=TTDatHome+is+OPEN%21%21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Teach Them Diligently</a>
<ul>
<li>I have not been to a Teach Them Diligently conference yet, but I am extremely excited that they are offering so much of their conference online right now.  It is $20 (super cheap for so much GREAT info) or $60 which includes a membership (membership is normally $99, so another great deal).  I really respect the leadership at Teach Them Diligently and this is another great resource for looking into homeschooling or for veteran homeschoolers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://homeschoolsummits.com/parenting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parent Summit</a>
<ul>
<li>This is a parent summit, lot's of solid speakers encouraging parents.  We have attended their online homeschool summits before and enjoyed the Biblical teaching we received so I am sure this new parenting summit will be uplifting and Biblical also.  It is free.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="www.daveramsey.com/hope" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Financial Peace University</a>
<ul>
<li>We love Dave Ramsey and I respect that during this difficult time financially for so many people Ramsey Solutions is offering the Financial Peace University class absolutely free for 2 weeks.  You can totally binge watch it.  Even if you have already seen it, chances are it could be an older version you saw and you will learn something new or hear something afresh in it.  This is a GREAT tool to pass on to friends or family as we all know people drastically impacted financially through these recent times.</li>

                <p>Recently I was talking to a friend who asked what we do for family devotions or how we study the Bible with our boys.  I think she hoped for a long, detailed excellent plan with deep theology, but my answer was simple.  We read the Bible and pray for others.  We are so blessed to have a lot of great resources and solid teaching at our fingertips via books, podcasts, articles, and sermons online, in our bookstores and libraries.  But sometimes I think we complicate things. </p>
<p>I do have a deep desire and pray every day that my boys will grow to be men of God who LOVE God's Word as any true believing parent probably does.  So, if that's my desire, what am I do today to encourage them?</p>
<p>So, here's our deep secret of Bible study with our boys.  We read the Bible.  Somedays we read one or two verses either due to chaos ensuing with a tantrum or baby's poopy diaper or simply because the questions they had over 2 verses led into such great discussion that's all we chewed on for that day.  We don't have a "set" plan, I do NOT agree with making sure you get "this much" read every day.  Quality vs quantity.  We were in Nehemiah in late December and when the new year hit the boys asked if we could start at the beginning, so we are now in late March and we are about to Genesis 24.  My 5 year old asked if we would die before making it through the Bible, I laughed and said possibly.  The 7 year old asked when we would get through the Bible, I said at this rate, we should be done by the time you leave for college.  And I am okay with that.</p>
<p>We also focus on praying for others.  Each of us will choose a name out of a little box that has index cards with a family or individuals name on it.  We will each pray for that family and usually I am texting that person either a prayer, asking for prayer requests or just letting them know they were prayed for today.  It is fun, especially to share the younger boys prayers with friends/family.  The 5 year old prayed and thanked God for Mr. Gene and Mr. Gene's hot tub, because it is so fun.  Again, not deep theology here, but I hope and pray they are learning to focus first on Christ and then others.</p>
<p>There are some questions we ask each day after Bible reading that can help guide you:</p>
<ol>
<li>What does this text teach/reveal to us about God?  </li>
<li>What are the implications to obey?  I do not like the word application-how can I apply it?  Because in our self-centerdness we tend to apply it how we like it to fit, or how we think it should fit into our lives.  When I ask how am I to obey?  What is this text showing me about obedience in my own life, well then it's hard to combat.  It goes from application-self centered to obedience-self-sacrifice.  </li>
</ol>
<p>I was meeting with a mentor friend a few weeks ago I asked her now that she has grown kids what advice would she give me.  Her answer surprised me.  She said she never knew what deep impact her daily time in the Word had on her kids until recently (they're in college).  She said each of her kids has come to her individually and thanked her for her faithfulness and desire for the Word and how that has deeply impacted their walk and their lives.  Wow.  </p>
<p>I can't give my kids what I don't have.  I can't minister to them and teach them the Word if I don't know it and if I am not obeying it.  They're kids they know when you're faking it and they now hypocrisy from a very young age.  </p>
<p>Deuteronomy 6:4-9 says, "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.  You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.  And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart.  YOu shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise.  You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.  You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates."</p>
<p>I believe these verses call us as parents to a deeper faith for US first.  When I love the Lord with all my heart and my soul and my might then BY GOD'S GREAT GRACE I can teach them diligently to my children.  It becomes natural, not forced.  It is me beholding my great, great Savior and my children seeing and tasting that sweetness I am beholding.  </p>
<p>There are a few resources I have found to be helpful if you're new but have a desire to teach your children and discuss the Bible together.  </p>
<p>For prayer I have used a few things, but I think Leslie Nunnery at Teach Them Diligently has a fantastic Scripture based prayer guide for our kids.  You can find it <a href="https://teachthemdiligently.net/resources/prayers-for-my-children/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here at Teach Them Diligently's Website</a>.</p>
<p>Also, a book I would recommend to help get you started is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Neglected-Grace-Jason-Helopoulos-ebook/dp/B00DQBO290/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=a+Neglected+grace&amp;qid=1585260809&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Neglected Grace by Jason Helopoulos</a>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, don't stress.  Keep it simple.  Get in the Word daily yourself as much as possible, your walk with God will have a greater impact on your kids than you will ever know.  From that the conversations will naturally flow as your eyes begin to behold the majesty of God your kids will naturally be curious and discussion is sure to ensue.</p>

                <p>Fear, worry, stress, anxiety, job loss, financial strain and unparalleled health concerns.  Where are we going to turn when the stress comes?  I think this is a time for believers to rise up, this can be a time of revival.  A time that we lean into the Lord like never before and trust Him more deeply, because He is always trustworthy.</p>
<p>I am a certified Biblical counselor through <a href="https://biblicalcounseling.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACBC</a> and here are some practical tips for combatting fear and anxiety I would offer during these uncertain times.</p>
<ol>
<li>Think, Act, Feel.  We innately feel, act and then think, but if we are constantly acting off of our feelings-fear, worry, stress then we are not acting in a way that is honoring to God.  First we need to think rightly-ask God to renew our minds-help us to put off the wrong thoughts and sinful desires and put on what honors Him.  Ephesians 4:22-24</li>
<li>Memorize scripture: proclaiming the truth even to yourself is powerful.  If we are going to fill our minds with the latest on the coronavirus we will be consumed with thoughts about the coronavirus.  If we choose to fill our minds with the truth of God's Word we can be consumed with thoughts of truth and peace no matter what the circumstances.  Here is a short list of some Scriptures to memorize regarding fear/worry:  
<ul>
<li>Romans 8:15</li>
<li>2 Timothy 1:7</li>
<li>Hebrews 13:5-6</li>
<li>Psalm 27:1</li>
<li>Psalm 56:3-4, 10-11 </li>
<li>1 John 4:18</li>
<li>Philippians 4:4-8</li>

                <p>We are definitely living in a different world than we were just a few weeks ago.  There is not a person unaffected, so during these challenging times we can get bitter or better and I choose better.  I exhort you to set an example to your kids in these times, not an example of perfection but an example of choosing to be a blessing where you can, being patient and enduring with grace and love.    </p>
<p>I know a lot of moms or dads or grandparents are home with kids right now unexpectedly and for God only knows how long, so I wanted to offer some great tips of things to do during this time.</p>
<p>It's our nature to be focused on ourselves and a time like this is no exception and is a time where you see that selfishness even more.  So, here are 6 things to do with your kids to focus on others!</p>
<p><strong>6 ideas to focus on others while quarantining!</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Write a letter or draw a picture for:
<ul>
<li>first responders</li>
<li>local firehouse</li>
<li>local police station</li>
<li>local courthouse/government</li>
<li>military/service men and women either those you personally know or go <a href="https://www.operationgratitude.com/express-your-thanks/write-letters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li>
<li>family/friends you currently cannot visit</li>
<li>pediatrician/family doctor and nurses</li>
<li>local hospital or nursing home staff</li>
<li>pastors/pastoral staff</li>
<li>teachers/school staff</li>
<li>someone you know who is in the hospital or nursing home or go <a href="http://www.cardsforhospitalizedkids.com/make-cards.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li>
<li>local grocery store-have you seen these peoples faces recently?  I am pretty sure a simple thank you and a card from a child thanking them would make their day pretty easily!</li>
<li>think of people in your area that may be feeling the impact in a different and possibly more difficult way than you and your family and encourage them with a letter of thanks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pray for:
<ul>
<li>our government</li>
<li>those who have lost someone to this virus</li>
<li>doctors and nurses</li>
<li>those working to develop and find a cure or vaccine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anonymously bless a neighbor with something they may need: some money in an envelope, some diapers left on their porch, some toilet paper for goodness sakes!  Make it a little care package-put some kleenex, hand sanitizer, a nice note in it.</li>
<li>Do chores for each other-each person come up with something (within reason) that would be helpful to another family member and do it.</li>
<li>Make a craft for someone your child loves: neighbors, grandparents, parents, etc.  </li>
<li>CALL a friend.  Calling someone is when your cell phone actually goes up to your ear and you talk to the person, you can even hear their voice.  It's a completely lost art nowadays, we don't know our phones can be used for talking besides talk text.  Call a different friend each day to see how they are doing.  Try it, I think you'll like it!</li>

                <p>Being gluten or wheat free is difficult, one of the main food items my son misses is bread.  Our bread today is just not at all what it used to be and it is lacking nutrients and enzymes that once were there prior to so much processing.  This recipe is a very easy go to for me and I make it almost every day.  My son cannot have wheat or his tummy will hate him for it, so we have found spelt or barley flour to be preferrable for him.  I have tried this recipe with my King Arthur's Gluten Free flour and it did not work for me, but if you're brave go for a gluten free try!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ingredients</span></p>
<p>2 cups spelt flour</p>
<p>3 teaspoons baking powder</p>
<p>1/2 teaspon salt </p>
<p>3/4 cup water</p>
<p>1/4 cup oil (we use olive oil)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Directions</span></p>
<p>Pour all dry ingedients into a bowl and mix.  Then add wet ingredients and stir until dough is formed.  Spoon 2 tablespoons of dough for each biscuit on a cookie sheet.  Makes 6-9 biscuits.  Bake at 400° for 10-12 minutes. I like to take the measuring cup I had the oil in and mix about 2 teaspoons of honey in it and brush that on top of the biscuits once they come out of the oven.  </p>

                <p>If you live in Indiana you know the drill, wait 10 minutes and the weather will be different.  So, Spring is sometimes in the air currently in Indy!  At least spring break is right around the corner for most Indianpolis area schools, so I thought I would compile a short list of some fun places to visit in Indy on a tight budget.  We try to include as much education as possible so tagging on science and history to a family outing is easy and fun, even if you are on spring break!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Indiana War Memorial</span>-This is a beautiful building and admission is FREE.  It is a great museum, enjoyed by even the younger kids.  The helicopter is always the highlight for my boys.  There is easy street parking available at a minimal cost and with the museum being free it is worth the price.  There is a nice park in front of the memorial also and the Central Library is walking distance too.  </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Canal walk</span>-The canal is always a beautiful place to walk around, there are a few memorials you can check out on or right by the canal.  The 9/11 Memorial, Medal of Honor Memorial (beautiful at night), and the USS Indianapolis Memorial.  There is also a newer playground called the Colts Canal Playscape that is a great place for the kids to burn some energy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Newfields</span>-the art museum itself does cost, but if it is a nice day take full advantage of the beautiful outdoor acres.  There is a garden and 100 acres of nature with artwork throughout.  Areas to play, picnic and a pretty lake to enjoy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Garfield Park Conservatory</span>-this is a favorite for us around Christmas because they have trains and beautiful lights throughout the greenhouse area.  There is no charge, but they do ask for donation.  This is a nice getaway to be in nature in Indy when it is 15° outside in winter or enjoy the outdoor area also on warmer days.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eagle Creek Park</span>-Admission is $5 per vehicle for in county and $6 for out of county residents.  This park is beautiful and is one of the top 10 largest municipal parks in the country. They have hiking, boating, fishing and playgrounds just to name a few activites.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fort Harrison State Park</span>-This is our go to park on those beautiful, sunny Indiana days!  We love the creeks, hiking trails and the big slide is a favorite for our boys.  Fort Harrison also has horse rides available.  Admission is $7 for in state residents and $9 for out of state.</p>

                <p>"One person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike.  Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind."  Romans 14:5  </p>
<p>I believe this chapter of Romans is a great dose of what we need regarding school choices.  Paul is saying not to pass judgement on another believer because of their decisions, one can honor the Lord by eating and celebrating a holiday just as much as another can not eat and not celebrate a holiday and honor the Lord.  The point is that the Lord is honored.</p>
<p>So, I believe each parent should be fully convinced in their own mind that they are honoring God by their school choice for their child-public, private or homeschool.  I wanted to give that belief before diving into the topic of why we homeschool.</p>
<p>When my husband and I made the decision that we would homeschool our children I was fully prepared to hear the question regarding how our kids would ever be socialized.  Perhaps I haven't heard that because our boys have all 3 found a way to make friends with everyone from neighbors to grocery store employees and bank tellers.  The comments and questions I did not anticipate sort of strike a nerve for me. </p>
<p>Easily the number 1 comment is, "oh wow!  I don't know how you do it!  I could never homeschool my kids."  It doesn't strike a nerve because I get mad by any means, it strikes a chord of sadness.  Whatever the reasons are another mom may have for thinking she cannot homeschool is probably a complete lie.  Yes, you can homeschool.    </p>
<p>This idea that you have to be a saint to homeschool your children is rubbish.  No homeschool mom is a saint.  We may be brave or out of our minds, but a saint, no.  Homeschooling is a continuation of parenting.  For me personally, I cannot reconcile the scripture from Proverbs 22:6 "Train up a child in the way they should go..."</p>
<p>Those 10 words are why we homeschool.  I figured it this way.  There are 168 hours in a week.  We sleep roughly 56-70 hours of that week and if I sent my kids to school they would be gone 35-40 hours depending on travel time/bus, etc.  So, I would not be with my kids at least 91 hours of the 168 I have been given by God to train them up every week.  And of course, we live in a culture where we must keep busy, so add in the time for extra curricular activities or even minstry or volunteer involvement and that 91 hours dwindles even quicker.  We would be left with roughly 80 hours a week to train up our child in the way they should go.  Again, refer to paragraph 2 and 3 and remember I am not saying this is for every parent, I am saying this was our journey and our personal conviction.  </p>
<p>I cannot reconcile my God given role to train up my kids Biblically with spending 80 hours a week with them and having to be louder so to speak than any other training up in the way they should not go.  I am not homeschooling to protect my kids from the world, I am homeschooling to prepare my kids to be in the world and a culture I pray every single day they will impact for the kingdom of God.  I am also not homeschooling my children so they will be Christians, because my best efforts will never save my kids. </p>
<p>So, I am not a saint.  Nor will I ever be even if we successfully graduate 3 handsome young men from our home school.  Parenting is a task beyond our human ability to succeed.  Parenting is hard.  Homeschooling is hard.  As a believer it is the most sanctifying undertaking, but it is also an incredible opportunity to daily see grace upon grace and the hand of God, because there is no way I could do it in my own strength.   </p>
