thing I am focusing more on this year is specific time with each of my boys.  It doesn't matter how many kiddos you have or how old they are spending one on one time with them is so important.  I remember as a teenage girl acting like I didn't like spending time with my dad especially, but I loved it and always appreciated it.  So, even if they don't act like they enjoy it, giving your time is important and speaks volumes to kids of all ages. </p><p>So, what are some things you can do with your kids?  Nothing fancy is needed, but here is a list of budget friendly to save up special days to do with your kids.        </p><ol><li>Coffee shop/Ice cream-so simple, but honestly a fun time and great way to have one on one time.</li><li>Volunteer together-this one is a favorite of our oldest sons, you really do bond in a different way when you're both focused on others and experiencing something different together.  We start our kids at 5 at the homeless shelter helping serve food, usually they're at the dessert part so all they do is put the pre packaged dessert on the tray and smile and they get to interact with a lot of different people.</li><li>Rock climbing or hiking-even if you're not in an area that has a lot of hiking or rock climbing there are some fun indoor places in Indy our favorite is Climb Time.  Hiking is also a great time together to talk and explore, also more budget friendly.</li><li>Biking-our middle son loves to take one on one bike rides.  We talk some, but he really enjoys racing around the neighborhood together or packing up and going to a local park to explore or park and play on the playground together.</li><li>Take a walk-literally it's that simple.  </li><li>A night away-my husband and our middle son got a great out of season deal at a local hotel, what a blast they had.  One night away with just daddy swimming, ordering food in and playing games together in the hotel was definitely one of his highlights of the year.</li><li>Museum/zoo-it's so much fun to go with one child to a museum, whether it is a children's museum or zoo or science center to be able to focus on them and what they're interested in is quite fun.</li><li>Planetarium-we have a local planetarium that has some neat events throughout the year (when not a covid year).  </li><li>Budget friendly bookstore-this one is fun with older kids or kids who can read.  You don't have to spend a dime and it is really helpful to open up conversation.  We have different topics like: find a book that shows where you want to travel, find a book that was your favorite when you were younger, find a book you'd love to read this year, find a book about something you always wanted to learn.  There are so many topics you and your child can come up with and both enjoy and it gives you a lot to talk about.</li><li>Check out local library events-the library is chokful of great events, it is always a hidden gem in cities.</li><li>Look through old pictures or photo albums or even print some pictures.  Everyone takes pictures on their phone, but rarely prints them, look through some with your child and make a photo album together.  It will be fun to laugh at some memories and also tell them some stories of when they were a baby.</li><li>Bake or cook together-it's fun to have your child pick something they want to make and bake or cook it together.</li><li>Sports/music together-if it is a sport or instrument your child enjoys and it may not be your forte it is fun to have them teach you.  It is fun for them to teach you something especially something they enjoy.</li><li>Try something new together-maybe you'd be into a dancing class, photography class or a class with the DNR at your local state park, most experts in a field love to share their knowledge.</li><li>Go to a different restaurant for each course-appetizer at an Indian restaurant, main course at a seafood restaurant, dessert at an Italian restaurant.</li></ol><p>Whatever it is and whatever the age of your child I think one on one time is one of the most important things we can do with our kids through the years.  My husband and I try to do once a month time with each kid, if that sounds overwhelming to you, start somewhere.  It helps me to just put it on the calendar so nothing comes up.  At any age your child is going to appreciate it, again even if they don't act like it.  It's a time you're being intentional to hear that childs heart, do something they enjoy, make memories together and just let them know through the years that you enjoy being with them and want to be with them.  I steer clear of screen time, although that is still fun and you most certainly can watch a movie together, etc but I prefer to have our one on one time open for talking if the child wants to.  </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 1, 2021</p><ul
