               <p>"So, how did you two meet?"  </p>
<p>The question comes and I gulp hard, immediately the only question that comes through my mind is, how much can this person handle of "our story"?  Right, well, as you can guess it wasn't a conventional way my husband, Josh and I met.  In fact, in the 9 years I have been sharing our story no one has said, "oh yea, my friends met that way too!"  Most people are surprised, possibly a little confused, but I always hope everyone walks away seeing the magnificent, gracious God my husband and I serve.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful fall day in Indiana, the kind where the leaves haven't truly begun to fall, but they are vibrant with orange, red and yellow hues of Autumn.  I was asked to help a friend take photos at an event for a local rescue mission.  It was a homecoming event, interesting thing for a rescue mission, right?  Well, this was a homecoming event for all the men who had graduated the missions men's addiction recovery program and their families. </p>
<p>It was quite a peculiar event to me.  I had been a Christian quite some time, I had known grace and I had known the Gospel, but to be honest I believed certain people would never change.  The list was small, but there was still a list and at the top of the list I was convinced alcoholics do not change.  Of course, what a small view of God that was, but it was my belief at the time.     </p>
<p>So, here I am just doing my job of taking photos of families and people enjoying the games, food and fellowship, yet in my heart I was just baffled.  There were men with their wives and children laughing together and then I would hear testimony after testimony how that man and woman were reconciled after 3 years of separation due to his drug addiction.  Testimony of that dad who had burned every single bridge so badly his son wouldn't respond to phone calls, texts, letters, nothing, so in desperation he wrote his son a letter on a $5 bill because he knew he wouldn't throw it away.  Testimony after testimony of completey broken, unreconcilable circumstances being miraculously healed, mended and stronger than ever because of Christ.  </p>
<p>Apparently as I was just doing my job and my heart was being stirred to understand what I truly know of grace and mercy there was a man in the program.  A fresh recruit, nonetheless.  I think we both still blush when he utters the words, "I saw her from afar."  Josh had entered the program just a few short months before the homecoming event, he was in the first phase of the addiction recovery program and I caught his eye that fall day.  I had no idea he existed and that day began a 2 year crush he had on me.</p>
<p>I began working for an organization that worked in Burundi, Africa so I spent the next 2 years traveling back and forth to Africa minstering to orphans and widows and accepting my calling to be a single missionary woman for life.  The camp where the homecoming event took place is a beautiful, large property in the middle of nowehere.  My friend and I would visit and I loved to go down to their church services at the camp, but most of all I enjoyed getting away from the noise of the city right before I would leave for Africa.  I also frequently served at the rescue mission serving dinner to the homeless in downtown Indy.  It was January 2011, a bitter cold night and I went to the serve dinner at the rescue mission.  I rang the door bell and a handsome young man opened the door for me with excitement and a huge smile he said, "Hi, Michelle!" I smiled and said hello as I signed in and thought, how the heck does this dude know my name?  </p>
<p>We talked as we rolled silverware and we found out we were reading the same book.  First guy I ever met who read Tozer for fun in his free time.  I told him I was off to Africa for about 2 months and he asked if I would be at the camp church service that Sunday and I said I would.  After the church service that Sunday he came up to me and walked next to me to the car, he handed me a little booklet and told me he would be praying for me during my trip.  I thanked him and that was it.  All I knew about the guy was he was 2 weeks from finishing the internship part of the program, he was pretty cute, he read Tozer and his name was Josh.  I had no idea he had a crush on me for 2 years.  </p>
<p>I remember sitting in the backseat of my friends car on the way home that day as her and another woman chatted away and I cracked open the little booklet.  My heart may have skipped a beat as I saw he had written me a note and the booklet was a devotional book.  When I got home that day I went straight to my room and cried and prayed.  Who is this guy?  I don't know this guy!  I can't have "feelings" for some dude in a flippin' addiction recovery program!!!!  But that booklet.  He wrote a note about how he would pray for me and hoped this devotional book would help give me hope and strength as I was away from my family, friends and familiar life for 2 months, that I would lean into the Lord.  He could have just given me a note.  He could have given me any book.  But he gave me a devotional with the hope that I would lean into the Lord.</p>
<p>Well, my time in Africa was incredible.  I had sent Josh a short email simply saying thank you for the booklet.  He wasn't supposed to communicate until he graduated so I did not anticipate a return e-mail, if anything.  But every single day I was in Burundi God brought Josh to my mind and I prayed for him.  The one day I did not pray for him in the morning a fellow missionary was telling a Bible story to a group and talked about Sarai and Abram going to Hebron, which was the name of the camp Josh was located.  So, I prayed for him.  He graduated from the program in February and had permission to write me back, which he promptly did the very night he graduated.  We began communicating through e-mail during my time in Burundi and the e-mails were short at first and after 2 months they were basically novels back and forth.  3 times I remember freaking out and thinking, no way, this is insane.  I cannot develop feelings for a guy who JUST graduated an addiction recovery program!!!  And 3 times I knew the Lord was reminding me of what grace I have been given and that God is always trustworthy no matter what were to happen with this guy.  </p>
<p>Well, I returned home, he asked my dad for permission to date me and 4 months later asked my parents if he could propose to me, they said yes, he proposed and I said yes!  I used to think certain people could not or maybe just would not change.  There are numerous stories of heartache and relapse and we have walked beside many friends through those difficulties.  But there is this God and He does do miracles.  He takes what once was broken and somehow He makes it whole.  He takes a heart of stone and turns it into a heart of flesh.  He takes a thief and turns him into a generous man.  He alone can take a prideful, stubborn heart and soften it more and more each day.  So, as I share this story I hope and pray the same thing I do when I answer for someone in person.  My prayer is that this magnificent God we serve would be so evident in our story that others would know Him.  "We met at a men's addiction recovery program."</p>

                              <p>I am beyond blessed to be happily married to my husband and love growing older every day with him.  We have been blessed with 3 precious and wild boys.  We homeschool and we enjoy hiking and traveling as a family.  My faith in Jesus Christ is the most important thing in my life and I hope to encourage other moms and women to know Him more!
