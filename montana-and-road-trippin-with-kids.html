Idaho, Hawaii and Alaska, in my opinion Montana is the most underated state.  Why go?  It is beautiful, it has rolling hills, flat fields, mountains and wildlife galore.  The people.  Oh the people we met were the real deal.  Genuine and wonderful.  It is far away, because basically even if you live in a neighboring state you're going to be driving quite a while to get to a city or a village in Montana, but it will be worth the drive.  Not sure about driving?  Let me tell you how we not only survived but thrived and had a blast as a family driving 47 hours total from Indy to Glasgow, Montana. </p><p>First, audio dramas.  Different and better than audiobooks which have one narrator usually and my boys do not like the way the narrator uses "different" voices for different characters and I must agree, it can be annoying.  We have 3 favorite audio dramas.</p><ol><li><a href="adventuresinodyssey.com" title="Adventures in Odyssey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adventures in Odyssey</a>- I think most people in the Christian community are familiar with Focus on the Family and a lot are already familiar with Adventures in Odyssey.  I remember listening to AIO when I was a kid so a few years ago when our older boys were just 5 and 3 I checked an AIO CD out from our church library.  That was it.  The entire family was hooked.  We are still old school and buy CD's for our older vehicles but there are MP3 options and download options available too.  Wholesome, family oriented, real life and fun entertainment for the entire family.  </li><li><a href="jonathanpark.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Jonathan Park">Jonathan Park</a>- This one is more rare, but another favorite adventure series for the family.  We have listened to Jonathan grow up and heard his family seek the Lord and make prayer and the validity and inerrancy of Scripture of utmost importance.  Jonathan Park series focuses on creation science and refutes evolution in an exciting, informative and engaging way even for younger kids.</li><li><a href="lamplighter.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Lamplighter">Lamplighter</a>- Our first Lamplighter introduction was at a homeschool convention and we asked the employee what she would suggest for a new to Lamplighter family with young boys.  She suggested Teddy's Button and it is to this day the boys favorite.  Lamplighter audio dramas are intense, captivating and chok-full of excitement.  They have age recommendations that I would stick with especially for the more sensitive younger ones.  Lamplighter books are also great and we passed many a mile marker reading or listening to Lamplighter.</li></ol><p> </p><p>A few other ways we passed the time on our long drive was tackle box snacks.  Every morning before we hit the road I filled up each boys tackle box with snacks.  The rules were, these are your snacks for the trip today, period.  Eat them too quickly?  O'well that is what you get.  Drop them on the floor or in your carseat?  O'well that is what you get (and you will be helping clean out the car at our destination).  We got these the night before departure at Walmart for a few bucks each.  </p><figure class="post__image"><img class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.indyboymom.com/media/posts/27/IMG_9339.JPG" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://www.indyboymom.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_9339-xs.JPG 300w ,https://www.indyboymom.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_9339-sm.JPG 480w ,https://www.indyboymom.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_9339-md.JPG 768w ,https://www.indyboymom.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_9339-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://www.indyboymom.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_9339-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://www.indyboymom.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_9339-2xl.JPG 1600w" alt="" data-aspectratio="1.333333" width="4032" height="3024"></figure><p>There are a lot of printable game ideas too, my all time favorite is the license plate game.  You don't have to have a printable just write down every different state license plate you see and see if you can get all 50.  The alphabet game is another fun one, see who can get through the alphabet by seeing letters on signs or other vehicles.  X is always hard and a fun one to be stuck at for a while!</p><p>Lastly, all props to <a href="thedatingdivas.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="The Dating Divas">The Dating Divas </a>for this idea, but I made a banner with 12 Do Not Open Until signs.  At each location listed they were given a small bag or small present to open.  Each one contained either a book, an activity book, a game, or they're favorite: candy.  It was something they looked forward too and also a win for us that it kept us from hearing, "I'm bored" or "are we there yet?" a million times.</p><p>So, now that you have some ideas, go have an adventure with your family!  Do not be afraid to roadtrip together.  Even if it is just an hour or two away, go!  Enjoy your kids, don't turn a screen on and ask them questions, play a game together, enjoy an audio drama that you are so glued to that they ask you to keep listening even when you arrive!  Many people said we were crazy for taking 3 boys in a car for 47 hours, but let me tell you, my husband and I do not regret it and I am positive we never will.  Our kids have memories they will keep forever and we certainly do too.  There are always difficult times (like saying stop running in the hotel room a hundred times an hour), but the good far out weighs the bad when you're engaged and focused on your family.  And may I suggest Big Sky Country, Montana is a great place to start! </p><p>  </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on November 13, 2020</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a
