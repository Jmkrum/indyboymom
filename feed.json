            "content_html": "<p>It's the new year, happy New Year!  One thing I am focusing more on this year is specific time with each of my boys.  It doesn't matter how many kiddos you have or how old they are spending one on one time with them is so important.  I remember as a teenage girl acting like I didn't like spending time with my dad especially, but I loved it and always appreciated it.  So, even if they don't act like they enjoy it, giving your time is important and speaks volumes to kids of all ages. </p>\n<p>So, what are some things you can do with your kids?  Nothing fancy is needed, but here is a list of budget friendly to save up special days to do with your kids.        </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Coffee shop/Ice cream-so simple, but honestly a fun time and great way to have one on one time.</li>\n<li>Volunteer together-this one is a favorite of our oldest sons, you really do bond in a different way when you're both focused on others and experiencing something different together.  We start our kids at 5 at the homeless shelter helping serve food, usually they're at the dessert part so all they do is put the pre packaged dessert on the tray and smile and they get to interact with a lot of different people.</li>\n<li>Rock climbing or hiking-even if you're not in an area that has a lot of hiking or rock climbing there are some fun indoor places in Indy our favorite is Climb Time.  Hiking is also a great time together to talk and explore, also more budget friendly.</li>\n<li>Biking-our middle son loves to take one on one bike rides.  We talk some, but he really enjoys racing around the neighborhood together or packing up and going to a local park to explore or park and play on the playground together.</li>\n<li>Take a walk-literally it's that simple.  </li>\n<li>A night away-my husband and our middle son got a great out of season deal at a local hotel, what a blast they had.  One night away with just daddy swimming, ordering food in and playing games together in the hotel was definitely one of his highlights of the year.</li>\n<li>Museum/zoo-it's so much fun to go with one child to a museum, whether it is a children's museum or zoo or science center to be able to focus on them and what they're interested in is quite fun.</li>\n<li>Planetarium-we have a local planetarium that has some neat events throughout the year (when not a covid year).  </li>\n<li>Budget friendly bookstore-this one is fun with older kids or kids who can read.  You don't have to spend a dime and it is really helpful to open up conversation.  We have different topics like: find a book that shows where you want to travel, find a book that was your favorite when you were younger, find a book you'd love to read this year, find a book about something you always wanted to learn.  There are so many topics you and your child can come up with and both enjoy and it gives you a lot to talk about.</li>\n<li>Check out local library events-the library is chokful of great events, it is always a hidden gem in cities.</li>\n<li>Look through old pictures or photo albums or even print some pictures.  Everyone takes pictures on their phone, but rarely prints them, look through some with your child and make a photo album together.  It will be fun to laugh at some memories and also tell them some stories of when they were a baby.</li>\n<li>Bake or cook together-it's fun to have your child pick something they want to make and bake or cook it together.</li>\n<li>Sports/music together-if it is a sport or instrument your child enjoys and it may not be your forte it is fun to have them teach you.  It is fun for them to teach you something especially something they enjoy.</li>\n<li>Try something new together-maybe you'd be into a dancing class, photography class or a class with the DNR at your local state park, most experts in a field love to share their knowledge.</li>\n<li>Go to a different restaurant for each course-appetizer at an Indian restaurant, main course at a seafood restaurant, dessert at an Italian restaurant.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Whatever it is and whatever the age of your child I think one on one time is one of the most important things we can do with our kids through the years.  My husband and I try to do once a month time with each kid, if that sounds overwhelming to you, start somewhere.  It helps me to just put it on the calendar so nothing comes up.  At any age your child is going to appreciate it, again even if they don't act like it.  It's a time you're being intentional to hear that childs heart, do something they enjoy, make memories together and just let them know through the years that you enjoy being with them and want to be with them.  I steer clear of screen time, although that is still fun and you most certainly can watch a movie together, etc but I prefer to have our one on one time open for talking if the child wants to.  </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Recently I was talking with a friend who is in the thick of mothering little ones.  For me when we had 2 under 2 and 3 years old it was hard.  Very hard for me.  In fact, I am not joking that I was convinced someone would not survive and the most likely victim would be me.  I wish I had great encouraging advice that made my friends circumstances and the hardness of parenting the little years a bit lighter for her, but honestly, I had nothing to offer her.  </p>\n<p>I remember at that same season of life hearing a speaker at a moms group and the topic was not just surviving but thriving in motherhood.  At the end of it I felt inspirired, but I would say the inspiration quickly wore off as soon as I went to pick up my son from the nursery and tried to buckle his defiant self into the carseat.  As I look back on motherhood thus far there are few times I would say there is a lot of thriving going on.  I think we are so prone to discouragement when we don't feel like we're thriving as moms.</p>\n<p>As moms we feel like we are living in the movie Groundhog Day...forever.  Somehow the seasons change, but my boys are still doing the exact thing I could have sworn I disciplined them for yesterday, and the day before that and before that.  </p>\n<p>Perhaps you're in that boat.  Maybe it isn't the exact same circumstances, but maybe you can relate a little or a lot.  Maybe you're the mom holding a newborn and feeling the exhaustion of constant feedings and diaper changes and wardrobe changes because of the spit up or diaper malfunction.  Perhaps you're the mom with the toddler who has found he can now speak your language and enjoys yelling, \"no, mommy!\".  Or perhaps you're the mom of the teenager who is struggling at school and your own heart is breaking as you watch your child struggle in battle.  Whatever your season, whatever your circumstancial struggle is, we have all been there: discouragement.  </p>\n<p>We've lost sight in the valley of discouragement of the final destination-the mountain top, and that is okay.  I don't believe discouragement is a sin.  Perhaps when we are discouraged we are more apt to sin in various ways (gluttony, laziness, anger, or a myriad of selfishness), but to be discouraged is not a sin.  In our times of discouragement it is an opportunity.  An opportunity for faithfulness.  Faithful obedience to the next thing.  The next thing may not be glamorous, the next thing may not and probably will not provide relief.  But if we are faithful by His grace to obey Him and to do the next thing He has called us to do: get up and feed the baby, discipline the toddler in love again, ask for forgiveness again, pray over your child again; well, this is how we walk out of discouragement.  Not over night usually, but step by step.  I hope I can look back at the times of discouragment in motherhood and say by God's grace we didn't JUST survive it, and I highly doubt there will be many times I feel like I thrived in it, but I hope to be faithful through it.     </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>I was reading a book (<em>Thanksgiving on Plymouth Plantation by Diane Stanley</em>) with my kids recently and learned that it was Abraham Lincoln who made the last Thursday in November the official Thanksgiving holiday.  It was also not set as a time to remember the pilgrims and indians having a time of thanks together; that is called a fall festival which began hundreds of years prior to Thanksgiving Day and was an annual celebration feast after the harvest between the pilgrims and indians.  </p>\n<p>So, the actual Thanksgiving Day.  A day established in America during the middle of the Civil War.  A time to set aside in the midst of a war torn, divided country to give thanks to God for His faithfulness and blessings.  Seems ironic, huh?  To give thanks and think on blessings when not much is \"going right\".  Perhaps we should do the same though.  2020 has been a difficult year for most.  But if we take time out to remember all the good things that happened, the laughter even if it was over Zoom or Facetime and the blessings even of technology perhaps we can begin to agree with Abraham Lincoln, in a time of tumult there really is still a lot to be grateful for.  </p>\n<p>Ideas to spur on thankfulness with your family:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A thankfulness tree:  Grab a branch from the backyard and put it in a cup with rocks or something heavy to keep it in.  Then take scrap pieces of paper (if you're crafty cut them into leaves) and each day have each person write down what they are thankful for.</li>\n<li>A time of thanks, each night at dinner go around the table and ask each person what they are thankful for that day.</li>\n<li>Keep a thankfulness journal personally or as a family or better yet, both!  Write down what you're thankful for each day and be sure to look back at how faithful God has been and how many things we can give thanks for in all times.  </li>\n<li>Go on a prayer of thanks walk, thank God for different things your entire walk.</li>\n<li>Look up scripture references that include thanks and read them as a family.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cultivating a heart of gratitude is important in our lives and important to help guide our children toward also.  Have you ever spent time with someone who has \"the whole world against them\" at all times?  It doesn't matter what is going on in their lives, words of thanks are rarely uttered.  On the contrary I am not saying pretend everything is okay when it is a difficult season, however, I fully agree with President Lincoln that it is always a time of thanks.  There are always things to be grateful for, we just need to train our eyes and hearts to see them more often.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Okay, first thing is first, if you have not traveled to Montana, GO.  You must go.  I have now traveled to 47 states, missing only Idaho, Hawaii and Alaska, in my opinion Montana is the most underated state.  Why go?  It is beautiful, it has rolling hills, flat fields, mountains and wildlife galore.  The people.  Oh the people we met were the real deal.  Genuine and wonderful.  It is far away, because basically even if you live in a neighboring state you're going to be driving quite a while to get to a city or a village in Montana, but it will be worth the drive.  Not sure about driving?  Let me tell you how we not only survived but thrived and had a blast as a family driving 47 hours total from Indy to Glasgow, Montana. </p>\n<p>First, audio dramas.  Different and better than audiobooks which have one narrator usually and my boys do not like the way the narrator uses \"different\" voices for different characters and I must agree, it can be annoying.  We have 3 favorite audio dramas.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"adventuresinodyssey.com\" title=\"Adventures in Odyssey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adventures in Odyssey</a>- I think most people in the Christian community are familiar with Focus on the Family and a lot are already familiar with Adventures in Odyssey.  I remember listening to AIO when I was a kid so a few years ago when our older boys were just 5 and 3 I checked an AIO CD out from our church library.  That was it.  The entire family was hooked.  We are still old school and buy CD's for our older vehicles but there are MP3 options and download options available too.  Wholesome, family oriented, real life and fun entertainment for the entire family.  </li>\n<li><a href=\"jonathanpark.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Jonathan Park\">Jonathan Park</a>- This one is more rare, but another favorite adventure series for the family.  We have listened to Jonathan grow up and heard his family seek the Lord and make prayer and the validity and inerrancy of Scripture of utmost importance.  Jonathan Park series focuses on creation science and refutes evolution in an exciting, informative and engaging way even for younger kids.</li>\n<li><a href=\"lamplighter.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Lamplighter\">Lamplighter</a>- Our first Lamplighter introduction was at a homeschool convention and we asked the employee what she would suggest for a new to Lamplighter family with young boys.  She suggested Teddy's Button and it is to this day the boys favorite.  Lamplighter audio dramas are intense, captivating and chok-full of excitement.  They have age recommendations that I would stick with especially for the more sensitive younger ones.  Lamplighter books are also great and we passed many a mile marker reading or listening to Lamplighter.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A few other ways we passed the time on our long drive was tackle box snacks.  Every morning before we hit the road I filled up each boys tackle box with snacks.  The rules were, these are your snacks for the trip today, period.  Eat them too quickly?  O'well that is what you get.  Drop them on the floor or in your carseat?  O'well that is what you get (and you will be helping clean out the car at our destination).  We got these the night before departure at Walmart for a few bucks each.  </p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://www.indyboymom.com/media/posts/27/IMG_9339.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\"></p>\n<p>There are a lot of printable game ideas too, my all time favorite is the license plate game.  You don't have to have a printable just write down every different state license plate you see and see if you can get all 50.  The alphabet game is another fun one, see who can get through the alphabet by seeing letters on signs or other vehicles.  X is always hard and a fun one to be stuck at for a while!</p>\n<p>Lastly, all props to <a href=\"thedatingdivas.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"The Dating Divas\">The Dating Divas </a>for this idea, but I made a banner with 12 Do Not Open Until signs.  At each location listed they were given a small bag or small present to open.  Each one contained either a book, an activity book, a game, or they're favorite: candy.  It was something they looked forward too and also a win for us that it kept us from hearing, \"I'm bored\" or \"are we there yet?\" a million times.</p>\n<p>So, now that you have some ideas, go have an adventure with your family!  Do not be afraid to roadtrip together.  Even if it is just an hour or two away, go!  Enjoy your kids, don't turn a screen on and ask them questions, play a game together, enjoy an audio drama that you are so glued to that they ask you to keep listening even when you arrive!  Many people said we were crazy for taking 3 boys in a car for 47 hours, but let me tell you, my husband and I do not regret it and I am positive we never will.  Our kids have memories they will keep forever and we certainly do too.  There are always difficult times (like saying stop running in the hotel room a hundred times an hour), but the good far out weighs the bad when you're engaged and focused on your family.  And may I suggest Big Sky Country, Montana is a great place to start! </p>\n<p>  </p>",

will keep your whole family smiling and laughing the entire book.  My oldest son loved Paddington so much for a few weeks he was found wearing a blue coat and begging to put a marmalade sandwich in his red hat in case of an emergency.  The first movie is quite cute also and fun to watch after reading the book.</p>\n<p><a
