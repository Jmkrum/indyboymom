            "content_html": "<p>Dear first time mom, (Letter 2)</p>\n<p>Are you feeling inadequate?  Worn out?  Like you can't remember when you last showered, slept or maybe you just napped in the shower?  This job of motherhood is HARD.  The only perfect parents are those without kids.  Right?  Remember when you were single and you sat at a restaurant rolling your eyes, oh so subtly, at the screaming baby or tantrum throwing toddler in the next booth?  And those words you dared to speak, \"When I have kids they definitely won't act like that.\"  Don't worry we were all that foolish at one point and then we had our first child.  Turns out this parenting thing is crazy hard and impossible without the grace of God.</p>\n<p>Watch out for the sin trap of comparing.  Comparison will rob you of the joy of motherhood.  Don't look at every other moms posts and pictures and compare yourself and your child.  I think every time we do that and think she has it all together or I wish I had that we are saying to an almighty, all knowing, wise God, \"You didn't do this right.\"  Or \"I need something else besides what You have given me.\"  God gave your child to you and His ways are perfect, beyond our understanding.  He placed this child in your arms for a specific reason.  He has given you and your husband the task of raising this child in the way they should go.  Rest in Him, trust Him, follow Him and seek hard after Him.  There's nothing better you could do for your child.</p>\n<p>With my first son I struggled a lot with devotions or what my time with God was to look like in that season of life.  I thought I still needed to be having half hour to an hour long time in the Word.  If I ever had a half hour sitting in that season of life I was asleep in the first 5 minutes for sure!  Your time with God will change, it is inevitable.  It is also imperitive that you have time with God.  I personally think it looks different for each mom in each season.  God has always cared about our soul, our motives.  If we are genuinely seeking Him, wanting to know Him more and humbly desiring to obey Him I think He is honored whether we are in the Word for 10 minutes or 60 minutes.    </p>\n<p>A few tips to help in the ever changing seasons of having a little one:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Listen to the Bible on audio. </li>\n<li>Keep a Bible next to where you nurse or often sit with the baby.</li>\n<li>Listen to solid sermons or podcasts.  Rich in the Word and truth.  Some examples:\n<ul>\n<li>Look at the Book from DesiringGod.com</li>\n<li>John Piper sermons</li>\n<li>Heidi St John podcast</li>\n<li>Risen Motherhood podcast</li>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>   </p>\n<p>    </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Dear first time mom,</p>\n<p>I reached out to a few friends and have compiled some advice and encourage for you as you begin your new journey of motherhood. Maybe you can feel that little bundle swirling around inside you as you read this or maybe you’re up at midnight with pregnancy heartburn. Whatever your scenario is right now, the most important thing to know is, this baby is a gift from God. Psalm 127:3 says, “Children are a blessing, a gift from the Lord.” There is no planner way to say it, and I find it interesting and profound that God did not put stipulations on when a child is a blessing. For example, He did not say children are a blessing if their born in wedlock when you’re expecting him/her. Or to those who have enough money saved up to pay for everything the baby needs in the first year of life, He doesn’t even put the stipulation that the child must come from your womb to be a blessing and a gift. He simply says, “Children are a blessing, a gift from the Lord.” So, sweet momma who is tired already remember this child is a blessing and a gift from God Himself so be thankful for the gift.</p>\n<p>Advice you have probably already received is to rest when your baby rests. There is a reason who have already received this advice, because it is true and you should do it. More than that you should not feel guilty about the dishes, laundry or mess in the living room you should just REST. Raising, training and healing are hard work. Also, even when the baby is awake take time to just enjoy the gift of this life. The laundry, dishes and dust will always be there, but these precious moments to watch your child grow and learn will fly by. Try to relish them before they’re gone.</p>\n<p>Be gracious. You and your husband are new to this parenting thing, and the truth is it doesn’t matter if you have 1 or 10 kids we are all fully reliant on the grace of God every day in life and parenting. Take time AWAY from the baby even if it is just an hour to talk to your husband, be with him, ask him about his work, remember he was the one you fell in love with first and he will be the one holding your hand when you’re wrinkly and gray-haired. Nurture your relationship with your husband. Accept help offered by friends to babysit or bring a meal or hold the baby. All of these things are taking something off your plate and you will be a better woman for it. Be gracious with your husband as he learns you in the role of motherhood, it won’t come overnight to either of you but stick together, remember you’re on the same team and God has given you a great task TOGETHER to nurture and raise a child in the way they should go.</p>\n<p>Now pray over that sweet baby and get some rest, sweet momma.</p>\n<p>I’ll write more later, sincerely,</p>\n<p>         Michelle K</p>",

Everyone who eats these asks for the recipe and then I chuckle a little and say these are so easy you’ll think I’m lying. But alas, I am not. There are so many great things about this recipe I love. There are 3 ingredients! They are ooey and super gooey, quick, easy and delicious healthier option cookies. This recipe does not make a ton so I am not tempted to eat 2 dozen cookies, and they’re perfect for a little family surprise dessert. I think my absolute favorite thing about these is how easy it is for the kids to help without me stressing about a mess. </em></p>\n<p><em>I confess, I get stressed when those big brown eyes come and ask me if their little hands can “help” me in the kitchen. Every mom everywhere knows that just means you have more to clean up, but with these cookies it is so doable and dare I say even enjoyable for all. They are still processed chocolate chips so I can’t call them healthy, but they are a healthy and certainly healthier option than most. So, here it is the long awaited healthy option cookie recipe.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Healthy Option Cookies</p>\n<p>Makes about 8-10 cookies</p>\n<p>2 bananas</p>\n<p>1 cup oats (GF oats for Gluten allergy)</p>\n<p>½ cup chocolate chips (Enjoy Life-allergy friendly or dark chocolate)</p>\n<p>Directions</p>\n<p>Mash bananas add oats and chocolate chips.
