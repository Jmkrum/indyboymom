I confess I was too, but these are a hit. This is my go to for an easy to make dessert so my allergy son can have a treat when we go to cookouts, birthday parties or the like. </em></p>\n<p><em>They have a deeper taste than your run of the mill brownie mix or even gluten free brownie mix. I have had a lot of compliments from people that they are still sweet, but a very nice subtle sweetness. These are allergy friendly for no gluten or dairy and the big bonus is my kids are getting fiber (beans) and good fat (avocado and coconut oil) without even knowing it! Mom win!</em></p>",
