            "content_html": "<p>I was reading a book (<em>Thanksgiving on Plymouth Plantation by Diane Stanley</em>) with my kids recently and learned that it was Abraham Lincoln who made the last Thursday in November the official Thanksgiving holiday.  It was also not set as a time to remember the pilgrims and indians having a time of thanks together; that is called a fall festival which began hundreds of years prior to Thanksgiving Day and was an annual celebration feast after the harvest between the pilgrims and indians.  </p>\n<p>So, the actual Thanksgiving Day.  A day established in America during the middle of the Civil War.  A time to set aside in the midst of a war torn, divided country to give thanks to God for His faithfulness and blessings.  Seems ironic, huh?  To give thanks and think on blessings when not much is \"going right\".  Perhaps we should do the same though.  2020 has been a difficult year for most.  But if we take time out to remember all the good things that happened, the laughter even if it was over Zoom or Facetime and the blessings even of technology perhaps we can begin to agree with Abraham Lincoln, in a time of tumult there really is still a lot to be grateful for.  </p>\n<p>Ideas to spur on thankfulness with your family:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A thankfulness tree:  Grab a branch from the backyard and put it in a cup with rocks or something heavy to keep it in.  Then take scrap pieces of paper (if you're crafty cut them into leaves) and each day have each person write down what they are thankful for.</li>\n<li>A time of thanks, each night at dinner go around the table and ask each person what they are thankful for that day.</li>\n<li>Keep a thankfulness journal personally or as a family or better yet, both!  Write down what you're thankful for each day and be sure to look back at how faithful God has been and how many things we can give thanks for in all times.  </li>\n<li>Go on a prayer of thanks walk, thank God for different things your entire walk.</li>\n<li>Look up scripture references that include thanks and read them as a family.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cultivating a heart of gratitude is important in our lives and important to help guide our children toward also.  Have you ever spent time with someone who has \"the whole world against them\" at all times?  It doesn't matter what is going on in their lives, words of thanks are rarely uttered.  On the contrary I am not saying pretend everything is okay when it is a difficult season, however, I fully agree with President Lincoln that it is always a time of thanks.  There are always things to be grateful for, we just need to train our eyes and hearts to see them more often.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Okay, first thing is first, if you have not traveled to Montana, GO.  You must go.  I have now traveled to 47 states, missing only Idaho, Hawaii and Alaska, in my opinion Montana is the most underated state.  Why go?  It is beautiful, it has rolling hills, flat fields, mountains and wildlife galore.  The people.  Oh the people we met were the real deal.  Genuine and wonderful.  It is far away, because basically even if you live in a neighboring state you're going to be driving quite a while to get to a city or a village in Montana, but it will be worth the drive.  Not sure about driving?  Let me tell you how we not only survived but thrived and had a blast as a family driving 47 hours total from Indy to Glasgow, Montana. </p>\n<p>First, audio dramas.  Different and better than audiobooks which have one narrator usually and my boys do not like the way the narrator uses \"different\" voices for different characters and I must agree, it can be annoying.  We have 3 favorite audio dramas.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"adventuresinodyssey.com\" title=\"Adventures in Odyssey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adventures in Odyssey</a>- I think most people in the Christian community are familiar with Focus on the Family and a lot are already familiar with Adventures in Odyssey.  I remember listening to AIO when I was a kid so a few years ago when our older boys were just 5 and 3 I checked an AIO CD out from our church library.  That was it.  The entire family was hooked.  We are still old school and buy CD's for our older vehicles but there are MP3 options and download options available too.  Wholesome, family oriented, real life and fun entertainment for the entire family.  </li>\n<li><a href=\"jonathanpark.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Jonathan Park\">Jonathan Park</a>- This one is more rare, but another favorite adventure series for the family.  We have listened to Jonathan grow up and heard his family seek the Lord and make prayer and the validity and inerrancy of Scripture of utmost importance.  Jonathan Park series focuses on creation science and refutes evolution in an exciting, informative and engaging way even for younger kids.</li>\n<li><a href=\"lamplighter.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Lamplighter\">Lamplighter</a>- Our first Lamplighter introduction was at a homeschool convention and we asked the employee what she would suggest for a new to Lamplighter family with young boys.  She suggested Teddy's Button and it is to this day the boys favorite.  Lamplighter audio dramas are intense, captivating and chok-full of excitement.  They have age recommendations that I would stick with especially for the more sensitive younger ones.  Lamplighter books are also great and we passed many a mile marker reading or listening to Lamplighter.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A few other ways we passed the time on our long drive was tackle box snacks.  Every morning before we hit the road I filled up each boys tackle box with snacks.  The rules were, these are your snacks for the trip today, period.  Eat them too quickly?  O'well that is what you get.  Drop them on the floor or in your carseat?  O'well that is what you get (and you will be helping clean out the car at our destination).  We got these the night before departure at Walmart for a few bucks each.  </p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://www.indyboymom.com/media/posts/27/IMG_9339.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\"></p>\n<p>There are a lot of printable game ideas too, my all time favorite is the license plate game.  You don't have to have a printable just write down every different state license plate you see and see if you can get all 50.  The alphabet game is another fun one, see who can get through the alphabet by seeing letters on signs or other vehicles.  X is always hard and a fun one to be stuck at for a while!</p>\n<p>Lastly, all props to <a href=\"thedatingdivas.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"The Dating Divas\">The Dating Divas </a>for this idea, but I made a banner with 12 Do Not Open Until signs.  At each location listed they were given a small bag or small present to open.  Each one contained either a book, an activity book, a game, or they're favorite: candy.  It was something they looked forward too and also a win for us that it kept us from hearing, \"I'm bored\" or \"are we there yet?\" a million times.</p>\n<p>So, now that you have some ideas, go have an adventure with your family!  Do not be afraid to roadtrip together.  Even if it is just an hour or two away, go!  Enjoy your kids, don't turn a screen on and ask them questions, play a game together, enjoy an audio drama that you are so glued to that they ask you to keep listening even when you arrive!  Many people said we were crazy for taking 3 boys in a car for 47 hours, but let me tell you, my husband and I do not regret it and I am positive we never will.  Our kids have memories they will keep forever and we certainly do too.  There are always difficult times (like saying stop running in the hotel room a hundred times an hour), but the good far out weighs the bad when you're engaged and focused on your family.  And may I suggest Big Sky Country, Montana is a great place to start! </p>\n<p>  </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Recently I was talking to a friend who asked what we do for family devotions or how we study the Bible with our boys.  I think she hoped for a long, detailed excellent plan with deep theology, but my answer was simple.  We read the Bible and pray for others.  We are so blessed to have a lot of great resources and solid teaching at our fingertips via books, podcasts, articles, and sermons online, in our bookstores and libraries.  But sometimes I think we complicate things. </p>\n<p>I do have a deep desire and pray every day that my boys will grow to be men of God who LOVE God's Word as any true believing parent probably does.  So, if that's my desire, what am I do today to encourage them?</p>\n<p>So, here's our deep secret of Bible study with our boys.  We read the Bible.  Somedays we read one or two verses either due to chaos ensuing with a tantrum or baby's poopy diaper or simply because the questions they had over 2 verses led into such great discussion that's all we chewed on for that day.  We don't have a \"set\" plan, I do NOT agree with making sure you get \"this much\" read every day.  Quality vs quantity.  We were in Nehemiah in late December and when the new year hit the boys asked if we could start at the beginning, so we are now in late March and we are about to Genesis 24.  My 5 year old asked if we would die before making it through the Bible, I laughed and said possibly.  The 7 year old asked when we would get through the Bible, I said at this rate, we should be done by the time you leave for college.  And I am okay with that.</p>\n<p>We also focus on praying for others.  Each of us will choose a name out of a little box that has index cards with a family or individuals name on it.  We will each pray for that family and usually I am texting that person either a prayer, asking for prayer requests or just letting them know they were prayed for today.  It is fun, especially to share the younger boys prayers with friends/family.  The 5 year old prayed and thanked God for Mr. Gene and Mr. Gene's hot tub, because it is so fun.  Again, not deep theology here, but I hope and pray they are learning to focus first on Christ and then others.</p>\n<p>There are some questions we ask each day after Bible reading that can help guide you:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What does this text teach/reveal to us about God?  </li>\n<li>What are the implications to obey?  I do not like the word application-how can I apply it?  Because in our self-centerdness we tend to apply it how we like it to fit, or how we think it should fit into our lives.  When I ask how am I to obey?  What is this text showing me about obedience in my own life, well then it's hard to combat.  It goes from application-self centered to obedience-self-sacrifice.  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>I was meeting with a mentor friend a few weeks ago I asked her now that she has grown kids what advice would she give me.  Her answer surprised me.  She said she never knew what deep impact her daily time in the Word had on her kids until recently (they're in college).  She said each of her kids has come to her individually and thanked her for her faithfulness and desire for the Word and how that has deeply impacted their walk and their lives.  Wow.  </p>\n<p>I can't give my kids what I don't have.  I can't minister to them and teach them the Word if I don't know it and if I am not obeying it.  They're kids they know when you're faking it and they now hypocrisy from a very young age.  </p>\n<p>Deuteronomy 6:4-9 says, \"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.  You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.  And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart.  YOu shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise.  You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.  You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.\"</p>\n<p>I believe these verses call us as parents to a deeper faith for US first.  When I love the Lord with all my heart and my soul and my might then BY GOD'S GREAT GRACE I can teach them diligently to my children.  It becomes natural, not forced.  It is me beholding my great, great Savior and my children seeing and tasting that sweetness I am beholding.  </p>\n<p>There are a few resources I have found to be helpful if you're new but have a desire to teach your children and discuss the Bible together.  </p>\n<p>For prayer I have used a few things, but I think Leslie Nunnery at Teach Them Diligently has a fantastic Scripture based prayer guide for our kids.  You can find it <a href=\"https://teachthemdiligently.net/resources/prayers-for-my-children/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here at Teach Them Diligently's Website</a>.</p>\n<p>Also, a book I would recommend to help get you started is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Neglected-Grace-Jason-Helopoulos-ebook/dp/B00DQBO290/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=a+Neglected+grace&amp;qid=1585260809&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A Neglected Grace by Jason Helopoulos</a>.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, don't stress.  Keep it simple.  Get in the Word daily yourself as much as possible, your walk with God will have a greater impact on your kids than you will ever know.  From that the conversations will naturally flow as your eyes begin to behold the majesty of God your kids will naturally be curious and discussion is sure to ensue.</p>",
