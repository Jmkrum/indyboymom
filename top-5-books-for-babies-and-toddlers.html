and thankfully so can my boys!  Our youngest quickly caught on and by 1 year old he was grabbing his own book choice and bringing it to my husband or I so he could be picked up, set on our lap and read to.  Sure, there attention spans don't last long, but starting that habit and letting it be a joy for you and the baby/toddler is worth more than you know!  </p><p>Sarah Mackenzie in her <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0310350328/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0310350328&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=indyboymom-20&amp;linkId=4c3c499ed4ed7878dcc2adeba2e95f26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">book the Read Aloud Family</a> has a lot of great statistics and studies regarding the benefits of reading aloud to our kids.  It does create a love for reading, teaches and also develops relationship between the reader and the one(s) being read to.  I can attest to those results also. </p><p>I have heard so many times, I can't read to him, he won't sit still!  Or he doesn't seem like he is paying attention at all.  I understand.  Trust me, I have 3 boys.  I strongly believe it is not our boys not listening or paying attention (of course, there is that at times, but I am referring to the majority of the time).  Instead, I think our ideas of the ideal reading scenario must change.  Typically those of us who grew up in a school setting think if you are not still you are not learning.  There is so much research out now to prove that wrong and in fact there are those who learn BEST when moving around.  My oldest is proof.</p><p>When we began homeschooling he would not sit still, I thought school must be done at the table, everything quiet with no distractions and we must get through this much curriculum to be successful.  That is actually how I learn best, with it quiet and no distraction, my son however the more he moves the more engaged he is.  I do not understand it, but I do accept it because I have experienced it. </p><p>Kids in general and boys especially typically need to move and it is okay.  The benefits of reading out loud even if your baby or toddler is playing with their toys or chewing on a teether or eating a snack is still beneficial.  Just the sound of your voice, hearing the language, and as they age beginning to understand and follow the story line is beneficial to your sweet baby's growing mind and development.  In my opinion reading aloud to our kids even as babies is one of the most significant actions we can perform as parents for them, it is right up there with praying over them in my book.</p><p>So, here are 5 books I suggest because they have been fun for all 3 of my boys as babies and toddlers!</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/161067362X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=161067362X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=indyboymom-20&amp;linkId=8259df52172d06c1a8fcd034df942f56" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">All Better</a>-this book is so cute!  It actually has stickers-don't be scared though (I too hate sticker books since the stickers rarely end up on the pages).  These are reuasable stickers.  They really are great, ours have lasted a year and a half and they are still sticking!  You clean the owie, kiss it, then put a bandage on it-all better!  It is an Usborne title so if you have an Usborne rep buy from them.</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1523504684/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1523504684&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=indyboymom-20&amp;linkId=e473698384e8a4569d35332f077461f4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indestructibles</a>-these books are great for babies.  A great way to get babies used to a book and pages and of course, to read to them.  It is a step out from the normal baby board book and is a paperback of sorts, but it really is indestructible for babies.  They can chew on it/drool on it and you can clean them without ruining the pages.  They can try to tear them or throw the book (not encouraged, but hey it happens!) and they do not tear or get destroyed.  Also, they are inexpensive, usually found for under $5.  Antoher huge pro for me, a book that lasts long for multiple kids!  Every daycare should have these for sure!!</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0746093691/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0746093691&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=indyboymom-20&amp;linkId=c9c00eaa66eaecac6854b66923e6d838" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That's Not My...Books</a>-Another Usborne title and there are a lot to choose from in the That's Noy My books.  This link is for That's Not My Truck, because it has been a favorite for my boys.  What we love about these books is the diffierent textures and simple wording.  It does teach them what smooth is because they are feeling the smooth trailer of the truck and at the end of the book they "find" the truck or subject of the book.  There is also a little mouse on each page, so these books are versatile in what they teach and how your child can interact.</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399226907/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0399226907&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=indyboymom-20&amp;linkId=3da0f6a32d081696cbadc5e34ad533d1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Very Hungry Caterpillar</a>-A classic from Eric Carle, he has a lot of them but for us there was none greater than The Very Hungry Caterpillar.  I will know this book like a high school actor remembers his lines from his senior play his entire life.  Perhaps not dietarily accurate, but it does depict the process that a caterpillar goes through in one day turning into a butterfly.  My boys have always liked touching the little holes in the book that represent the caterpillar chewing through said food item.    </li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0310708257/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0310708257&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=indyboymom-20&amp;linkId=d82a4601273df578dcad8d893394c11a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Jesus Storybook Bible</a>-I don't think kids are ever too young to hear Bible stories and engage with them.  Although this not a board book, therefore be careful with little hands tearing, it is one we would read a story from every day.  Usually at breakfast and the kids can engage in the pictures and story while the baby is safely in his high chair unable to tear, but able to engage nonetheless.  The illustrations are well done and the stories are wonderful, because Sally Lloyd-Jones truly does a great job of teaching how every story points to the Messiah, Jesus.  </li></ol></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 22, 2020</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a
